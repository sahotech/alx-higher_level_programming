<h1>Handling Exception in Python</h1>

<p> When an exception occurs, it may have associated values, also known as the exceptionâ€™s arguments. The presence and types of the arguments depend on the exception type.</p>

<p>The except clause may specify a variable after the exception name. The variable is bound to the exception instance which typically has an args attribute that stores the arguments</p>
